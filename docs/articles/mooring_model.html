<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>Anchored oceanographic mooring lines are deformed by currents, in
much the same way as trees are bent by wind. For very simple moorings,
e.g. consisting of a single float connected by a uniform cable to an
anchor at the bottom, the deformation can be calculated if the current
is uniform. The physics is analogous to the sagging of telephone lines
between poles, and falls into the general category of a catenary.
However, things are more complicated for depth-varying currents, and for
mooring lines that consist of many elements, of varying buoyancy and
drag, connected by wires, chains, etc., that are also of varying
buoyancy and drag.</p>
<p>An approach to analysing realistic oceanographic moorings is to use
lumped-mass theory, in which elements such as floats and instrument
packages are parameterized by their buoyancy and drag characteristics,
and in which cables envisioned as connected line elements. This approach
was taken by <span class="citation">Dewey (1999)</span> in a GUI-based
Matlab system. The present treatment is of similar foundation, although
with some added simplifications (such as unidirectional current) that
are relevant to the basic problem of computing “knock-down”, i.e. the
vertical displacement of instruments that is caused by slanting of the
mooring line.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="model">Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model"></a>
</h2>
<p>Consider the case of unidirectional horizontal current aligned with
the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis. Following oceanographic
convention, let <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> be the vertical
coordinate, positive upwards, with <span class="math inline">\(z=0\)</span> at the surface. The mooring is
modelled as a series of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> connected
elements, with the top element being numbered <span class="math inline">\(i=1\)</span> and the bottom one numbered <span class="math inline">\(i=n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Water density and velocity are assumed to be a functions of depth,
with values <span class="math inline">\(\rho_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u_i\)</span> at the location <span class="math inline">\(z_i\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th element.</p>
<p>Each element is described by the following properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>Height, <span class="math inline">\(H_i\)</span> [m]. This is is the
vertical extent of the element as placed in a completely taut
(i.e. vertical) mooring.</li>
<li>Area, <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> [m<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>] projected in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> direction, again for an element as it
would be oriented in a taut mooring.</li>
<li>Buoyancy ‘force’ expressed in kilograms, i.e. the actual force in
Newtons, divided by <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, the
acceleration due to gravity. For a solid object such as a float or
instrument, this is a simple number, denoted <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> below. For a wire or chain, it is
expressed per unit length of cable, i.e. in kg/m, and denoted <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i\)</span> below. Manufacturers tend to
provide <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> values in technical documentation
about mooring components. Note that they refer to in-water buoyancy
force, but the distinction between freshwater and seawater is seldom
made clear.</li>
<li>Drag coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(C_i\)</span>, defined
as the ratio of drag force, <span class="math inline">\({\cal
D}_i\)</span>, to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}A_i\rho_i
u_i|u_i|\)</span>.</li>

</div>
<p>A tension force exists between each interior mooring element. The
tension below the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th interior
element (thus pulling downward on it) is denoted <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_i\)</span>. This is defined for all
elements of a mooring except for the bottom one, which is labelled <span class="math inline">\(i=n\)</span>.</p>
<p>The tension force is directed vertically if there is no current, but
acquires a horizontal component if there is a current, because drag from
the current will distort the mooring shape. The angle made by the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th element to the vertical is
represented with <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span>.
Determining these two quantities, <span class="math inline">\({\cal
T}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, is the key to
inferring the response of a mooring to currents.</p>
<p>Quasi-steady dynamics are assumed, so that forces must balance in
both the horizontal and vertical directions. The tension force has
components in both the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> directions, but the buoyancy force
(defined as positive for objects that would rise if unattached to a
mooring) acts only in the vertical, upwards if <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is positive.</p>
<p>The buoyancy force for a solid object such as an anchor or a float is
found with <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{1}
{\cal B}_i = -g m_i
\end{equation}\]</span> while it is represented with <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{2}
{\cal B}_i = -g \mu_i \Delta l_i
\end{equation}\]</span> for a portion of a cable of length <span class="math inline">\(\Delta l_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>The drag force is expressed with <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{3}
{\cal D}_i = \frac{1}{2} A_i C_i \rho_i u_i |u_i|
\end{equation}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span>
is the area projected in the flow direction.</p>
<p>With these definitions, a steady-state assumption dictates that
forces must be balanced in the horizontal and vertical directions for
each element of the mooring.</p>
<p>Consider the case of a mooring consisting of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements attached to an immovable
bottom anchor, and let the index <span class="math inline">\(i=1\)</span> refer to the top element, with <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> increasing to <span class="math inline">\(i=n\)</span> at the anchor.</p>
<p>Three forces are involved in this situation: (a) a horizontal drag
force, <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}\)</span>, associated with
the current, (b) a vertical buoyancy force, <span class="math inline">\({\cal B}\)</span>, caused by a density mismatch
between a component and the background water, and (c) a tension force,
<span class="math inline">\({\cal T}\)</span>, along the connection
between elements. The tension force has only a vertical component for an
upright mooring, but horizontal components occur for a mooring that is
tilted by a current.</p>
<p>By definition, the top element has no tension from above, and so a
consideration of its force balance yields <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{4}
{\cal D}_1 = {\cal T}_1 \sin\phi_1
\end{equation}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{5}
{\cal B}_1 = {\cal T}_1 \cos\phi_1
\end{equation}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\({\cal
T}_1\)</span> is the tension between this element and the one below it,
and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_1\)</span> is the angle that this
tension force makes to the vertical.</p>
<p>Consider first the case of a depth-independent current, so that the
drag <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> on the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th element my be computed without
consideration for the position of the element in the water column. In
such a case, both <span class="math inline">\(D_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_1\)</span> are known, these two equations may be
solved for <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_1\)</span>, yielding <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{6}
{\cal T}_1 = \sqrt{{\cal D}_1^2 + {\cal B}_1^2}
and
\end{equation}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{7}
\phi_1 = \tan^{-1}\frac{{\cal D}_1}{{\cal B}_1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>If there are more than 2 elements in the mooring, this same reasoning
may be extended to the next element, although now there is a tension
force pulling upward. This situation is described by <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{8}
{\cal D}_2 + {\cal T}_1 \sin\phi_1 = {\cal T}_2 \sin\phi_2
\end{equation}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{9}
{\cal B}_2 + {\cal T}_1 \cos\phi_1 = {\cal T}_2 \cos\phi_2
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\phi_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_1\)</span> are known from Equation 5,
Equation 6 may be solved for <span class="math inline">\({\cal
T}_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_2\)</span>, using
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{10}
{\cal T}_2 = \sqrt{({\cal D}_2+{\cal T}_1\sin\phi_1)^2 + ({\cal
B}_2+{\cal T}_1\cos\phi_1)^2}
\end{equation}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{11}
\phi_2 = \tan^{-1}\frac{{\cal D}_2+{\cal T}_1\sin\phi_1}{{\cal
B}_2+{\cal T}_1\cos\phi_1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>This may be generalized to larger moorings, with <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{12}
{\cal T}_i = \sqrt{({\cal D}_i+{\cal T}_{i-1}\sin\phi_{i-1})^2+({\cal
B}_i+{\cal T}_{i-1}\cos\phi_{i-1})^2}
\end{equation}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{13}
\phi_i = \tan^{-1}\frac{{\cal D}_i+{\cal T}_{i-1}\sin\phi_{i-1}}{{\cal
B}_i+{\cal T}_{i-1}\cos\phi_{i-1}}
\end{equation}\]</span> applying for elements <span class="math inline">\(i=2,\dots,n-1\)</span>. The limit ends at <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> because is no tension below the
bottom element, so neither <span class="math inline">\({\cal
T}_n\)</span> nor <span class="math inline">\(\phi_n\)</span> can be
defined.</p>
<p>This leads to a simple way to describe mooring response to a
depth-independent current, in which <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_i\)</span> are known quantities for each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> from 1 to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>First, use Equations 4 through 7 to compute <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_1\)</span>, the angle and tension below the
top (<span class="math inline">\(i=1)\)</span> element.</li>
<li>Use Equations 12 and 13 to compute <span class="math inline">\({\cal
T}_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i=2\)</span>.</li>
<li>Continue as in step 2, until reaching the bottom (<span class="math inline">\(i=n-1\)</span>) element.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the current varies with depth, then the drag of a given element
will depend on depth of the element, which in turn depends on the shape
of the mooring. This may be handled by an iterative scheme. In the first
iteration, the vertical positions of mooring elements are inferred by
summing their heights, and the above procedure is used to infer <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span>. Then, these angles are used to
calculate a second estimate of element locations, and the procedure is
repeated using drags appropriate to those locations. This may be
repeated until the solution converges to within a stated criterion. In
practice, for professional moorings that are sufficiently taut to meet
scientific objectives, the changes in element depths are likely to be
only a few percent of water depth, and so the need for iteration is
arguable, given that uncertainties about velocity variations on such
scales.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the result of simulating a 20-inch Hydro Float Mooring
Buoy (with <span class="math inline">\(34.5\)</span>kg buoyancy)
connected to a bottom anchor with 100 m of quarter-inch jacketed wire
(with <span class="math inline">\(-13\)</span>kg/m of buoyancy), in a
depth-independent 0.5 m/s (roughly 1 knot) current. Note that the float
is predicted to sink <span class="math inline">\(7.7\)</span>m with this
current. However, the predicted knockdown increases to <span class="math inline">\(41.2\)</span>m with a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>m/s current, suggesting that this float
would be of limited utility in supporting an oceanographic mooring a
region with strong currents.</p>

</h2>
<p>As a special case, if <span class="math inline">\(u_i=0\)</span> for
all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, then there will be no drag,
and so (assuming adequate buoyancy), the mooring will be aligned in the
vertical, and the vertical equation becomes <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{14}
{\cal T}_{i+1} = {\cal T}_i + {\cal B}_i
\end{equation}\]</span> which yields <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tag{15}
{\cal T}_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} {\cal B}_j
\end{equation}\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i&gt;1\)</span>.
Physically, this means that the downward tension at any level balances
the total upward buoyancy force of all the elements above it. The bottom
tension, <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_n\)</span>, may be
interpreted as the minimum anchor weight that will hold the mooring in
place in the absence of currents. However, it should be obvious that
heavier weights will be required for practical situations.</p>
