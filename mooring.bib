	abstract = {Mooring Design and Dynamics is a set of Matlab® routines that can be used to assist in the design and configuration of single point oceanographic moorings, the evaluation of mooring tension and shape under the influence of wind and currents, and the simulation of mooring component positions when forced by time-dependent currents. The static model will predict the tension and tilt at each mooring component, including the anchor, for which the safe mass will be evaluated in terms of the vertical and horizontal tensions. Predictions can be saved to facilitate mooring motion correction. Time-dependent currents can be entered to predict the dynamic response of the mooring. The package includes a preliminary database of standard mooring components which can be selected from pull down menus. The database can be edited and expanded to include user specific components, frequently used fasteners/wires etc., or unique oceanographic instruments. Once designed and tested, a draft of the mooring components can be plotted and a list of components, including fasteners can be printed.},

Direct evidence of this mooring motion is provided by accelerometer records that reveal high-frequency (0.2–0.4 Hz) displacements normal to the absolute flow direction that are as much as 0.5 m in amplitude. Current meter measurements are up to 40\% lower than concurrent rates measured by a ship-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). The result supports the hypothesis of Loder and Hamilton that rate underreading occurs when cross-flow motion of the current meters causes a rotor shielding effect arising from meter misalignment with the fluctuating relative water velocity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Measurements from an instrumented mooring in which spherical in-line buoyancy is replaced with streamlined flotation are also presented. Here the variance of the measured cross-flow acceleration is typically reduced by two orders of magnitude, and current meter and ADCP records are in excellent agreement. Besides greatly improving mooring stability and current meter data quality, use of the streamlined packages also reduces the overall drag on the mooring thereby significantly reducing instrument excursions and inclinations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},
