#' @param rho a numeric value giving
#' water density in kg/m^3. The default value of 1027 is
#' likely to be sufficient for most calculations, given that
#' oceanographic variations of density are typically well under 1
#' percent, although it might make sense to use a smaller value
#' in lake applications.  Note that the overall force balance
#' is more sensitive to other things, as discussed in the \dQuote{Details}
#' section of the documentation for [buoyancy()].
