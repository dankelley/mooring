#' @param height numeric value for the height (in m) of the element.
#' This value is used in the computation of the mooring geometry.
#' In some cases, as e.g. in Dewey-derived data that have "diameter" tabulated
#' as zero, it is also used in the computation of the area
#' of the element, as height*width.
#' Note that `height` is ignored if `model` is recognized.
