# Introduction

Members of Centre for Marine Applied Research (CMAS) sent me information on
their mooring equipment, in a combination of emails and a csv file. For details
of how I processed these, see the `work/cmar.R` and `work/Makefile` files.

The results of the processing are as follows, with buoyancy in kg, distance in
metres, and area in square metres. All these entries are incorporated into the
built-in objects.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(read.csv("anchors_cmar.csv"), caption="Contents of the `anchors_cmar.csv` file.")
knitr::kable(read.csv("floats_cmar.csv"), caption="Contents of `floats_cmar.csv` file.")
knitr::kable(read.csv("instruments_cmar.csv"), caption="Contents of `instruments_cmar.csv` file.")
knitr::kable(read.csv("wires_cmar.csv"), caption="Contents of `wires_cmar.csv` file. Note that long names are shown in two lines, and that the headers for `buoyancyPerMeter` and `areaPerMeter` are mashed together in the PDF version of this `README.Rmd` file.")
```
