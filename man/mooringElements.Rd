\usage{
data(mooringElements)
}
\description{
This dataset was constructed from the \code{mdcodes.mat} (Dewey 1999, 2021).
This is provided for use by \code{\link[=wire]{wire()}}, \code{\link[=chain]{chain()}} and \code{\link[=float]{float()}}.
Users will seldom need to consult this table directly, but those that
do should note that Dewey's lengths in cm have been converted to m.
