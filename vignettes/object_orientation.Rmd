The S3 scheme is used for objects created by functions in the `mooring`
package. These objects inherit from the `"mooring"` class.  The contents
consist of a list that in turn contains one or more lists.

The elementary functions, such as `anchor()`, `wire()`, `float()`, etc.,
produce objects with main class `"mooring"` and sub-class with the function
name.  The contents vary from subclass to subclass.  Allowances for these
different aspects are made in `knockdown()`, as it computes drag and buoyancy
forces on elements.

For example,
```{r}
library(mooring)
m <- mooring(anchor(depth=100), wire(length=75), float())
```
produces a list with 3 elements, one that holds information on the anchor, a
second that holds information on the wire, and a third that holds information
on the float.
