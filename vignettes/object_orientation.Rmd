The S3 scheme is used for objects created by functions in the `mooring`
package. These objects inherit from the `"mooring"` class.  The contents
consist of a list that in turn contains one or more lists.

The elementary functions such as [anchor()], [cable()] and [float()] all
produce a list that contains a single list describing the item.  That item
contains elements called `type` that indicate the meaning (e.g. [cable()]
produces objects with type equal to `"cable"`), as well as an element called
`model`, which is a string indicating the particular variety of cable.

The combination function, [+,mooring()], produces a list that contains 2 or
more lists, one for each element.  For example,
```{r}
library(mooring)
m <- anchor() + cable(100) + float()
```
produces a list with 3 elements, one that holds information on the anchor,
a second that holds information on the cable (whih is 100 m long in this case),
and a third that holds information on the float.
