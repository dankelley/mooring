The prediction of this effect requires knowledge of the drag coefficients for the mooring components. Drag coefficients, known for simple geometric shapes such as spheres or cylinders, are commonly used for mooring response computations. Selected mooring components (buoyancy elements and instruments) were tested in a tow tank to determine their actual drag coefficients. Over the Reynolds Number range, typical of oceanic conditions, deviations of the drag coefficient up to 50\% are found when compared with the appropriate simple geometric shape coefficients. A set of model moorings and model current profiles is used to determine the resulting changes in component depth level and displacement. The changes in horizontal displacement of the upper part of the mooring are on the order of 10\% in extreme cases and 1\% under typical conditions. Their effects on current measurements will usually be negligible. However, the related vertical displacements are on the order 100 to 10 m.

            An internally recording, autonomous instrument has been tested for measurements of ocean turbulence from a mooring line. Measurements were made at a single level in the water column, but for an extended period of time, at a predetermined duty cycle. The instrument is designed to measure, independently, in two different parts of the turbulence wavenumber spectrum: eddy correlation measurements in the inertial subrange and small-scale shear and temperature gradient measurements in the dissipation subrange using shear probes and fast-response thermistors. For the deployment reported here, the instrument is located in the wave-affected layer, and only the dissipation subrange from the shear probes can be confidently utilized for turbulence measurements. The velocity spectra in the inertial subrange are severely contaminated by platform motion and noise, and the dissipation range of the temperature gradient spectrum is not satisfactorily resolved. The shear spectra are found to be relatively free of contamination in the 1–20-Hz frequency range and are used for dissipation rate calculations. The quality of the measurements is constrained by the angle of attack and the magnitude of mean flow relative to the wave oscillatory velocities. Dissipation rates are consistent with a scaling expected from breaking long waves, when background shear is weak, and are elevated when the gradient Richardson number is small, consistent with additional turbulence production by shear. While limited to a single depth, the instrument makes it possible to collect time series for 3 weeks continuously or for 3 months at a 25\% duty cycle.},

Direct evidence of this mooring motion is provided by accelerometer records that reveal high-frequency (0.2–0.4 Hz) displacements normal to the absolute flow direction that are as much as 0.5 m in amplitude. Current meter measurements are up to 40\% lower than concurrent rates measured by a ship-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). The result supports the hypothesis of Loder and Hamilton that rate underreading occurs when cross-flow motion of the current meters causes a rotor shielding effect arising from meter misalignment with the fluctuating relative water velocity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Measurements from an instrumented mooring in which spherical in-line buoyancy is replaced with streamlined flotation are also presented. Here the variance of the measured cross-flow acceleration is typically reduced by two orders of magnitude, and current meter and ADCP records are in excellent agreement. Besides greatly improving mooring stability and current meter data quality, use of the streamlined packages also reduces the overall drag on the mooring thereby significantly reducing instrument excursions and inclinations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},
