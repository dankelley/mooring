# Introduction

The `mooring` package deals with oceanographic moorings and their deformation
by horizontal currents. The theory for that deformation is laid out in the
vignetted entitled *Mooring Response to Unidirectional Flow*, while the present
vignette deals with using the package.

# Constructing mooring objects

Moorings are constructed with `mooring()`, the arguments of which, called
'elemental` objects, are created by `anchor()`, `chain()`, `float()`,
`instrument()`, `release()`, or `wire()`.  These are specified from bottom to
top.  For example, consider a mooring in water of depth 200m, with a 150-m long wire
connecting a bottom anchor to a float.  This could be created with
```{r}
library(mooring)
m <- mooring(anchor(depth=200), wire(length=150), float())
```
where each of the function calls that construct the arguments has taken on a
default value.  To learn the possible values for any of these, supply a first
argument as the string `"?"`, e.g. the possible wire types (which include
non-metallic wires) is:
```{r}
wire("?")
```

More details on the functions are provided with e.g. `?wire`.  Details of the
objects are provided in the vignette called *Default Values for Mooring
Elements*.  Each element has information that the package can use to find
forces that control mooring shape.  The horizontal drag force at a given water
speed depends on the object's frontal area and drag coefficient.  The vertical
buoyancy force depends on the buoyancy of the element, which is expressed (in
kg) mass equivalents (assuming $g=9.8$m/s$^2$ for the acceleration of gravity)
for discrete elements such as floats and instruments, and in buoyancy per
length (in kg/m) for wires.

Note that new types of wire, float, etc. can be created easily, by supplying a name
that is not matched in the list of built-in values. The help pages for the
various functions explain what must be specified.

Actual moorings are likely to have multiple instruments, along with multiple
buoyancy elements, but the mooring just created is sufficient to continue the
discussion here.


# Calculating mooring shape in a current

The `knockdown()` function is used to compute the shape of a mooring that is
deformed by a horizontal current.  It takes just two arguments: the mooring,
and the velocity. The latter may be a fixed value (in m/s), or a function that
gives velocity as a function of depth below the water surface.

But, before applying `knockdown()`, it is important to first subdivide any
`wire` elements into smaller lengths, so that `knockdown()` can compute the
shape more precisely.  This is done with the `discretise()` function.  The
following shows how to do this with the mooring just created.
```{r}
md <- discretise(m) # breaks wire portions into approx. 1-m segments
```
and the knocked-down mooring is found with e.g.
```{r}
mdk <- knockdown(md, u=1)
```
for a 1 m/s current.

# Accessing mooring shape and properties

The functions `x()` and `z()` find the $x$ and $z$ locations of mooring
elements.  Note that $z=0$ at the surface and negative in the water column; use
`depth()` to get depth below the surface.

For example, the shape of the knocked-over mooring from the previous code
block could be plotted with
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=3, dev.args=list(pointsize=9)}
plot(x(mdk), z(mdk), type="l")
```

Similarly, the tension between elements is found with `tension()`, and the angle that elements make to the vertical is found with `angle()`.

# Plotting mooring

The plot shown above is quite primitive, so the package offers a `plot()`
function.  For example, this gives a view of tension and shape.
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=3, dev.args=list(pointsize=9)}
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
plot(mdk, which="tension")
plot(mdk, which="shape")
```

In both instances, the gray line is the shape that would occur with no current.
Note that the shape plot uses a 1:1 aspect ratio, making it easier to
understand the result.  Also, note that depth is plotted here, as opposed to
the $z$ shown above.

A fancier version is obtained with
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=3, dev.args=list(pointsize=9)}
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
plot(mdk, which="tension", fancy=TRUE)
plot(mdk, which="shape", fancy=TRUE)
```

# Interactive R-shiny app

The package supplies `app()` as a convenient way to learn about the package.
By design, it does not offer a way to make complex moorings.  For example, it
only provides an anchor-wire-float mooring, with no way to add a bottom
release, instruments, floats, etc., nor is it possible to specify
depth-dependent currents.  Such things might be added later, of course.

The following is a screenshot of the case studied so far, but with a weaker
surface mooring (a 20-inch diameter Hydro-float Mooring
Buoy^[https://deepwaterbuoyancy.com/wp-content/uploads/hydro-float-mooring-buoys-deepwater-buoyancy.pdf]).
The knockdown is much higher than seen in the plots above, because the float
buoyancy is less than for that of the default float.  (As a guide, the menus of
app display the buoyancies of wire and float elements.)
