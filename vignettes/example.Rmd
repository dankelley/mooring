# Introduction

This shows a simulation of mooring 1840 on the Sackville Spur, based on a
diagram that appeared in a report provided by the Bedford Institute of
Oceanography (Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada) containing a Notice
to Mariners document.

# Source Document

```{r,fig.cap="**Diagram for Bedford Institute of Oceanograph mooring 1840 on Sackville Spur**", out.width="70%", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}

```

# Mooring Construction

```{r}
# Mooring 1840 (p10 of doc)
library(mooring)

# Abbreviations for convenience
W <- function(length) wire("3/16in galvanized wire coated to 1/4in", length=length)
BUB3 <- float("streamlined BUB 3 Viny balls")
RCM11 <- instrument("RCM-11 in frame") # "AANDERAA RCM11"
microcat <- instrument("SBE37 microcat clamp-on style") # "SBE MICROCAT"

m <- mooring(anchor(depth=1400),
             chain("5/8in galvanized chain", length=10),
             release("benthos 965a release"),  # dual benthos 965-a
             BUB3,
             W(34),
             microcat,
             RCM11,
             W(50),
             BUB3,
             W(144),
             microcat,
             RCM11,
             W(147),
             BUB3,
             W(46),
             microcat,
             RCM11,
             W(198),
             microcat,
             RCM11,
             W(198),
             microcat,
             RCM11,
             W(197),
             microcat,
             RCM11,
             W(146),
             microcat,
             connector("swivel"),
             connector("ballast", -100/2.2, height=1, width=0.05, CD=1),
             float("syn. float, bracket and 109lb ADCP"),
             W(149),
             microcat,
             float('new glass streamlined float c2'))
md <- discretise(m)
```



# Knockdown Simulation

For illustration, this simulation uses an entirely made-up velocity structure.
```{r, fig.cap="**Simulation of knockdown with a depth-decaying current.**", fig.height=4, fig.width=7, fig.align="center", out.width="100%", dev.args=list(pointsize=10)}
u <- function(depth) 0.5*exp(-depth/1000)
depth <- seq(m[[1]]$depth, 0, length.out=100)
layout(matrix(1:2,nrow=1), widths=c(0.75,0.25))
mdk <- knockdown(md, u=u)
plot(mdk, "knockdown", xlim=c(0,45), showDetails=TRUE)
plot(mdk, "velocity")
```
Note that the limit set on the first plot sets aside enough space for the
labels (and establishes a common scale used in a later exercise).

# Examining Moorings

## Overview

An overview of a mooring is provided by printing it, either with
```{r eval=FALSE}
print(m)
```
or, in an interactive session, with
```{r eval=FALSE}
m
```
For the mooring constructed above, the results are as follows.
```{r echo=FALSE}
m
```
The number at the start is the component number (see next section).

Note that the results for `md` will be similar, except there will be many more
elements (for the segmented chain and wire components).  If `mdk` is examined
in this way, the $x$ and $z$ values will be different. 

## Components

To learn more about, say, the second element (the chain from anchor to acoustic
release), use

```{r}
m[[2]]
```
and to see the full details, use
```{r}
dput(m[[2]])
```
or, with less detail but in a more digestible format,
```{r}
str(m[[2]])
```

You may go further with e.g.
```{r}
m[[2]]$width
```

**Exercise 1.** Double the chain density, to see the effect on knock-down.

**Exercise 2.** Double the drag coefficient on the wire, to see how much this
increases knockdown.


## Answers to Exercises

### 1. Doubling chain density

A simple way to do this is to create `m` as before, but then to use
```{r}
m[[2]]$buoyancyPerMeter <- 2 * m[[2]]$buoyancyPerMeter
```
before using `digitise()`, `knockdown()` and then `plot.mooring()`.  Before
doing that though, you should ask yourself whether you expect to see a large
effect.

### 2. Doubling wire drag

One way to do this is to replace the `W` definition with
```{r}
W <- function(length) {
    w0 <- wire("3/16in galvanized wire coated to 1/4in", length=1)
    wire("draggy wire", buoyancyPerMeter=w0$buoyancyPerMeter,
         diameter=w0$diameter, CD=2*w0$CD, length=length)
}
```
and then create `m`, `md` and `mdk` as before. The results are as follows. Note
that knockdown is more than doubled.  This makes determination of drag
coefficient an especially important factor in mooring design; see e.g.
@hamilton_validation_1989 and @hamilton_mooring_1997.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Simulation with doubled wire drag.**", fig.height=4, fig.width=7, fig.align="center", out.width="100%", dev.args=list(pointsize=10)}
m <- mooring(anchor(depth=1400),
             chain("5/8in galvanized chain", length=10),
             release("benthos 965a release"),  # dual benthos 965-a
             BUB3,
             W(34),
             microcat,
             RCM11,
             W(50),
             BUB3,
             W(144),
             microcat,
             RCM11,
             W(147),
             BUB3,
             W(46),
             microcat,
             RCM11,
             W(198),
             microcat,
             RCM11,
             W(198),
             microcat,
             RCM11,
             W(197),
             microcat,
             RCM11,
             W(146),
             microcat,
             connector("swivel"),
             connector("ballast", -100/2.2, height=1, width=0.05, CD=1),
             float("syn. float, bracket and 109lb ADCP"),
             W(149),
             microcat,
             float('new glass streamlined float c2'))
md <- discretise(m)
layout(matrix(1:2,nrow=1), widths=c(0.75,0.25))
mdk <- knockdown(md, u=u)
plot(mdk, "knockdown", xlim=c(0,45), showDetails=TRUE)
plot(mdk, "velocity")
```
