# Introduction

This vignette explains how to use the `mooring` package to create a simulation
of mooring 1840 on the Sackville Spur, based on a diagram that appeared in a
report provided by the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (Department of
Fisheries and Oceans, Canada) containing a Notice to Mariners document.

# Mooring Construction

# Abbreviations for convenience
W <- function(length) wire("3/16in galvanized wire coated to 1/4in", length = length)

# The database does not have a 5-wheel anchor, but we may construct

# Knockdown Simulation

For illustration, the simulation below uses an entirely made-up velocity
structure. Note the setting of `xlim` to provide space for the labels.

```{r, fig.cap="**Figure 2. Simulation of knockdown with a depth-decaying current.**", fig.align="center", out.width="100%", dev.args=list(pointsize=9)}
u <- function(depth) 0.3 * exp(-depth / 1400)
layout(matrix(1:2, nrow = 1), widths = c(0.75, 0.25))
msk <- knockdown(ms, u = u)
plot(msk, "knockdown", xlim = c(0, 4.0), showDetails = TRUE)
plot(msk, "velocity")
```

# Knockdown-Speed Diagram

We may get an idea of the overall response of the mooring to water velocity by
running simulations with a range of velocities.  Noting that the top of the
mooring, from the surface to 200m, is knocked over much more than the rest,
let's focus on the depth of the second microcat from the top, i.e. the one
below the ADCP.  Typing `ms` in a console gives an overview, from which one may
find the ADCP element using
```{r}
names <- sapply(ms@elements, \(e) e@model)
iADCP <- grep("ADCP", names)
iADCP
```

We may use this to construct a diagnostic curve giving an overview of the
mooring knockdown, as follows. Note that the $x$ axis of the resultant plot is
showing velocity at the depth of the ADCP.
```{r fig.cap="**Figure 3. Speed-knockdown summary diagram**", out.width="100%", fig.align="center", dev.args=list(pointsize=9)}
par(mar = c(3, 3, 1, 1), mgp = c(2, 0.7, 0), mfrow = c(1, 1))
N <- 10
u0 <- seq(0, 0.3, length.out = N)
dz <- rep(NA, N)
U <- rep(NA, N)
for (i in seq_len(N)) {
    u <- function(depth) u0[i] * exp(-depth / 1400)
    k <- knockdown(ms, u)
    U[i] <- u(-k@elements[[iADCP]]@z)
    dz[i] <- k@elements[[iADCP]]@z - ms@elements[[iADCP]]@z
}
plot(U, dz, lwd = 2, type = "l", xlab = "Velocity [m/s]", ylab = "Knockdown [m]")
grid()
mtext(sprintf("Knockdown for ADCP nominally at %.0f m depth", -ms@elements[[iADCP]]@z))
```
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
curve <- list(U = U, dz = dz)
save(curve = curve, file = "velocity_knockdown_prediction.rda")
```

# Examining Moorings

## Overview

An overview of a mooring is provided by printing it, either with
```{r eval=FALSE}
print(m)
```
or, in an interactive session, with
```{r eval=FALSE}
m
```

Note that the results for `ms` will be similar, except there will be many more
elements (for the segmented chain and wire components).  If `msk` is examined
in this way, the $x$ and $z$ values will be different.

## Components

To learn more about, say, the top element, use

```{r}
m@elements[[1]]
```

and, as shown previously, finer-grained access is achieved as, e.g.

```{r}
m@elements[[1]]@buoyancy
```


**Exercise 1.** Double the chain density, to see the effect on knock-down.

**Exercise 2.** Double the drag coefficient on the wire, to see how much this
increases knockdown.


## Answers to Exercises

### 1. Doubling chain density

A simple way to do this is to create `m` as before, but then to use
```{r}
m@elements[[2]]@buoyancy <- 2 * m@elements[[2]]@buoyancy
```
before using `digitise()`, `knockdown()` and then `plot.mooring()`.  Before
doing that though, you should ask yourself whether you expect to see a large
effect.

### 2. Doubling wire drag

One way to do this is to replace the `W` definition with
```{r}
W <- function(length) {
    w0 <- wire("3/16in galvanized wire coated to 1/4in", length = 1)
    wire("draggy wire",
        buoyancy = w0@buoyancy,
        area = w0@area, CD = 2 * w0@CD, length = length
    )
}
```
and then create `m`, `ms` and `msk` as before. The results are as follows. Note
that an axis change is required to capture the approximately-doubled knockdown.
This illustrates the importance of getting drag coefficient right, a matter
dealt with in detail by @hamilton_validation_1989 and @hamilton_mooring_1997.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Figure 4. As Figure 2, but doubled wire drag. Note the doubled range of the 'Depth Increase' axis, to accomodate the approximately doubled knockdown.**", fig.align="center", out.width="100%", dev.args=list(pointsize=9)}
u <- function(depth) 0.3 * exp(-depth / 1400)
mDraggy <- mooring(
    anchor(),
    chain("5/8in galvanized chain", length = 10),

mskDraggy <- knockdown(msDraggy, u = u)

plot(mskDraggy, "velocity")
