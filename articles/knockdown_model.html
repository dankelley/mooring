<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>Anchored oceanographic mooring lines are deformed by currents, in much the same way as trees are bent by wind. For very simple moorings, e.g. consisting of a single float connected by a uniform cable to an anchor at the bottom, the deformation can be calculated if the current is uniform. The physics is analogous to the sagging of telephone lines between poles, and falls into the general category of a catenary. However, things are more complicated for depth-varying currents, and for mooring lines that consist of many elements connected by cables.</p>
<p>An approach to analysing realistic oceanographic moorings is to use lumped-mass theory, in which elements such as floats and instrument packages are parameterized by their buoyancy and drag characteristics, and in which cables envisioned as connected line elements. This approach was taken by <span class="citation">Dewey (1999)</span> in a GUI-based Matlab system. The present treatment is of similar foundation, although with some added simplifications (such as unidirectional current) that are relevant to the basic problem of computing “knock-down”, i.e. the vertical displacement of instruments that is caused by slanting of the mooring line.</p>
</div>
<div id="model" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#model" class="anchor"></a>Model</h1>
<p>Consider the case of unidirectional horizontal current aligned with the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis. Following oceanographic convention, let <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> be the vertical coordinate, positive upwards, with <span class="math inline">\(z=0\)</span> at the surface. The mooring is modelled as a series of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> connected elements, with the top element being numbered <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Water density and velocity are assumed to be a functions of depth, with values <span class="math inline">\(\rho_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u_i\)</span> at the location <span class="math inline">\(z_i\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th element.</p>
<p>Each element is described by the following properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>Length, <span class="math inline">\(L_i\)</span> [m]. For a portion of cable, this has the common meaning. For a float, instrument, or other thing, it is the contribution that the item makes to the overall mooring length.</li>
<li>Area, <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> [m<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>] projected in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> direction.</li>
<li>A measure of buoyancy force divided by <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, the acceleration due to gravity. For a solid object, this is a simple number, expressed in kg, and denoted <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> below. For a cable, it is expressed per unit length of cable, i.e. in kg/m, and denoted <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i\)</span> below. Manufacturers tend to provide <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> values in technical documentation about mooring components. Note that they refer to in-water buoyancy force, but the distinction between freshwater and seawater is seldom made clear.</li>
<li>Drag coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(C_i\)</span>, defined as the ratio of drag force, <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_i\)</span>, to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}A_i\rho_i u_i|u_i|\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A tension force exists between each interior mooring element. The tension above the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th interior element (thus pulling upward on it) is denoted <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_i\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_{i+1}\)</span> represents the tension pulling down from below. These tensions will be directed vertically if there is no current, but they will have horizontal components with a current, because it will distort the mooring from its upright orientation. The angle made by the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th element to the vertical is represented with <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span>. Determining these two quantities, <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, is the key to inferring the response of a mooring to currents.</p>
<p>Quasi-steady dynamics are assumed, so that forces must balance in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The tension force has components in both the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> directions, but the buoyancy force (defined as positive for objects that would rise if unattached to a mooring) acts only in the vertical, upwards if <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is positive.</p>
<p>The buoyancy force for a solid object such as an anchor or a float is found with (Equation 1) <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
{\cal B}_i = -g m_i
\end{equation}\]</span> while it is represented with (Equation 2) <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
{\cal B}_i = -g \mu_i \Delta l
\end{equation}\]</span> for a portion of a cable of length <span class="math inline">\(\Delta l\)</span>.</p>
<p>The drag force is expressed with (Equation 3) <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
{\cal D}_i = \frac{1}{2} A_i C_i \rho_i u_i |u_i|
\end{equation}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> is the area projected in the flow direction.</p>
<p>With these definitions, a steady-state assumption dictates that forces must be balanced in the horizontal and vertical directions for each element of the mooring.</p>
<p>Consider the case of a mooring consisting of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements attached to an immovable bottom anchor, and let the index <span class="math inline">\(i=1\)</span> refer to the top element, with <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> increasing to <span class="math inline">\(i=n\)</span> at the anchor.</p>
<p>Three forces are involved in this situation: (a) a horizontal drag force, <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}\)</span>, associated with the current, (b) a vertical buoyancy force, <span class="math inline">\({\cal B}\)</span>, caused by a density mismatch between a component and the background water, and (c) a tension force, <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}\)</span>, along the connection between elements. The tension force has only a vertical component for an upright mooring, but horizontal components occur for a mooring that is tilted by a current.</p>
<p>By definition, the top element has no tension from above, and so its force balance is (Equation 4) <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
{\cal D}_1 &amp;= {\cal T}_2 \sin\phi_2\cr
{\cal B}_1 &amp;= {\cal T}_2 \cos\phi_2
\end{split}
\end{equation}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_2\)</span> is the tension between this element and the one below it, and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_2\)</span> is the angle that tension force makes to the vertical. These two equations may be solved for <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_2\)</span>, yielding (Equation 5) <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
{\cal T}_2 &amp;= \sqrt{{\cal D}_1^2 + {\cal B}_1^2}\cr
\phi_2 &amp;= \tan^{-1}\frac{{\cal D}_1}{{\cal B}_1}
\end{split}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>If there are more than 2 elements in the mooring, this same reasoning, extended to account for stress and angle below the first element, yields (Equation 6) <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
{\cal D}_2 + {\cal T}_2 \sin\phi_2 &amp;= {\cal T}_3 \sin\phi_3\cr
{\cal B}_2 + {\cal T}_2 \cos\phi_2 &amp;= {\cal T}_3 \cos\phi_3
\end{split}
\end{equation}\]</span> and, since <span class="math inline">\(\phi_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_2\)</span> are known from Equation 5, Equation 6 may be solved with (Equation 7) <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
{\cal T}_3 &amp;= \sqrt{({\cal D}_2+{\cal T}_2\sin\phi_2)^2 + ({\cal B}_2+{\cal T}_2\cos\phi_2)^2}\cr
\phi_3 &amp;= \tan^{-1}\frac{{\cal D}_2+{\cal T}_2\sin\phi_2}{{\cal B}_2+{\cal T}_2\cos\phi_2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>This may be generalized to larger moorings, with (Equation 8) <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
{\cal T}_i &amp;= \sqrt{({\cal D}_{i-1}+{\cal T}_{i-1}\sin\phi_{i-1})^2+({\cal B}_{i-1}+{\cal T}_{i-1}\cos\phi_{i-1})^2}\cr
\phi_i &amp;= \tan^{-1}\frac{{\cal D}_{i-1}+{\cal T}_{i-1}\sin\phi_{i-1}}{{\cal B}_{i-1}+{\cal T}_{i-1}\cos\phi_{i-1}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}\]</span> applying at each element, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p>This leads to a simple way to describe mooring response to a depth-independent current, in which <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_i\)</span> are known quantities for each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> from 1 to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>: 1. First, use Equation 5 to compute <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_2\)</span>, the angle and tension below the top element. 2. Then, use Equation 8 to compute <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i=3\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(i=4\)</span>, etc. until reaching <span class="math inline">\(i=n\)</span>.</p>
<p>(Note that <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_1\)</span> are not defined in this notation.)</p>
<p>If the current varies with depth, then the drag of a given element will depend on depth of the element, which in turn depends on the shape of the mooring. This may be handled by an iterative scheme. In the first iteration, the vertical positions of mooring elements are inferred by summing their heights, and the above procedure is used to infer <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span>. Then, these angles are used to calculate a second estimate of element locations, and the procedure is repeated using drags appropriate to those locations. This is repeated until the solution converges to within a stated criterion.</p>

<a href="#example" class="anchor"></a>Example</h1>
<p>Figure 1 shows the result of simulating a 20-inch Hydro Float Mooring Buoy (with <span class="math inline">\(34.5\)</span>kg buoyancy) connected to a bottom anchor with 100 m of quarter-inch jacketed wire (with <span class="math inline">\(-0.13\)</span>kg/m of buoyancy), in a depth-independent 0.5 m/s (roughly 1 knot) current. Note that the float is predicted to sink <span class="math inline">\(7.7\)</span>m with this current. However, the predicted knockdown increases to <span class="math inline">\(41.2\)</span>m with a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>m/s current, suggesting that this float would be of limited utility in supporting an oceanographic mooring a region with strong currents.</p>

<p>As a special case, if <span class="math inline">\(u_i=0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, then there will be no drag, and so (assuming adequate buoyancy), the mooring will be aligned in the vertical, and the vertical equation becomes <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
{\cal T}_{i+1} = {\cal T}_i + {\cal B}_i
\end{equation}\]</span> which yields <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
{\cal T}_i = \sum_{1}^{i-1} {\cal B}_j
\end{equation}\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i&gt;1\)</span>. Physically, this means that the downward tension at any level balances the total upward buoyancy force of all the elements above it. The bottom tension, <span class="math inline">\({\cal T}_n\)</span>, may be interpreted as the minimum anchor weight that will hold the mooring in place in the absence of currents. However, it should be obvious that heavier weights will be required for practical situations.</p>
